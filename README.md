Mini project - Home automation using Bluetooth module
Home automation is common today but often unaffordable and challenging for disabled individuals to use. My idea is to create an affordable home automation system for around 500 rupees, using components readily available at local electronic shops. This system includes voice and mobile app controls, designed to be simple and user-friendly. By utilizing an Arduino with a Bluetooth module (HC-05) and a relay module, users can easily convert their homes into smart homes with just a single click.
